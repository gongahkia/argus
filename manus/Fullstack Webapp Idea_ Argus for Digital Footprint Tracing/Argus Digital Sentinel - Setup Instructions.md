pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Node.js dependencies for frontend
cd argus-frontend
npm install  # or pnpm install
cd ..
```

### 2. Configuration
```bash
# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"

# Optional: Set custom OpenAI API base URL
export OPENAI_API_BASE="https://api.openai.com/v1"
```

### 3. Build Frontend
```bash
cd argus-frontend
npm run build  # or pnpm run build
cd ..

# Copy built files to Flask static directory
cp -r argus-frontend/dist/* src/static/
```

### 4. Start the Application
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Start the Flask server
python src/main.py
```

The application will be available at: **http://localhost:5000**

## Usage Guide

### Dashboard
- View overall risk score and trends
- Monitor active platforms and recent alerts
- Visualize risk distribution across platforms

### Platforms Management
1. Click "Platforms" tab
2. Add new platforms using the form:
   - Select platform type
   - Enter your username/handle
   - Click "Add Platform"
3. Start scans by clicking "Start Scan" for each platform

### Alerts Monitoring
- View risk alerts in the "Alerts" tab
- Alerts are automatically generated based on scan results
- Risk levels: Low (green), Medium (yellow), High (red)

### Reports Generation
- Generate comprehensive reports in the "Reports" tab
- Reports include detailed analysis and recommendations
- Export reports for external review

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (Flask)
- **Framework**: Flask with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT models for content analysis
- **Data Collection**: Modular platform-specific scrapers
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for frontend communication

### Frontend (React)
- **Framework**: React with Vite build system
- **UI Library**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization
- **Icons**: Lucide React icons

### Key Components
- `src/services/ai_analyzer.py`: AI-powered content analysis
- `src/services/data_collector.py`: Platform data collection
- `src/services/report_generator.py`: Report generation
- `src/routes/scan.py`: Scanning API endpoints
- `src/routes/reports.py`: Report generation endpoints

## Security & Privacy
- All data processing happens locally
- No data is sent to external services except OpenAI for analysis
- User credentials are never stored
- Scan results are stored locally in SQLite database

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Port already in use**: Change the port in `src/main.py`
2. **OpenAI API errors**: Verify your API key is set correctly
3. **Frontend build errors**: Ensure Node.js dependencies are installed
4. **Database errors**: Delete `instance/app.db` to reset database

### Development Mode
For development with hot reload:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Flask backend
source venv/bin/activate
python src/main.py

# Terminal 2: Start React frontend
cd argus-frontend
npm run dev  # or pnpm run dev
```

Frontend will be available at: http://localhost:5173
Backend API at: http://localhost:5000
