## Technical Feasibility Assessment

### AI Models for Local Deployment
1. **Hugging Face Local Deployment**
   - Can run models locally without API keys
   - Supports various model types (text analysis, sentiment analysis)
   - Good for privacy-focused applications
   - Multiple deployment options: Transformers, LangChain, Llama.cpp, Ollama

2. **WebLLM**
   - High-performance in-browser LLM inference engine
   - Uses WebGPU for hardware acceleration
   - Enables client-side AI without server dependencies
   - Perfect for privacy-sensitive applications like digital footprint analysis

### Available APIs for Data Collection
- **Twitter API**: Profile data, tweets, search functionality
- **LinkedIn API**: Profile data, people search, professional information
- **YouTube API**: Channel details, video metadata
- **TikTok API**: User information, basic profile data

### Web Scraping Considerations
- Legal in many jurisdictions but requires careful implementation
- Must respect robots.txt files and terms of service
- Rate limiting and ethical scraping practices essential
- Focus on publicly available information only
- Consider data privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA)

## Recommended Architecture

### Backend (Flask)
- RESTful API for data collection and analysis
- Integration with local AI models for content analysis
- Database for storing scan results and user preferences
- Scheduled scanning capabilities
- Rate-limited API calls to external services

### Frontend (React)
- Modern, responsive dashboard interface
- Real-time monitoring displays
- Risk assessment visualizations
- User-friendly reporting system
- Mobile-responsive design

### Core Features to Implement
1. **Profile Scanning**: Automated scanning of social media profiles
2. **Content Analysis**: AI-powered analysis of posts for potential risks
3. **Risk Assessment**: Scoring system for career/reputation risks
4. **Alerting System**: Notifications for concerning content
5. **Reporting**: Comprehensive reports with actionable insights
6. **Privacy Controls**: Local processing, no data sharing

## Feasible vs Unfeasible Features

### Feasible (Keep)
- Social media profile scanning (Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok)
- Local AI analysis using WebLLM or Hugging Face
- Risk scoring based on content analysis
- Dashboard with visualizations
- Scheduled monitoring
- Export reports

### Unfeasible/Risky (Remove/Modify)
- Aggressive scraping of private platforms
- Real-time monitoring of all platforms simultaneously
- Deep web/dark web monitoring
- Automated content deletion (legal/ethical issues)
- Monitoring of private/protected content

## Next Steps
1. Design detailed application architecture
2. Create project structure with Flask backend and React frontend
3. Implement core scanning and analysis features
4. Integrate local AI models for content analysis
5. Build user-friendly dashboard interface



## Additional Platforms for Monitoring

### Available via APIs
- **Reddit**: Subreddit posts, user activity analysis
- **Instagram**: Limited public data (via web scraping)
- **Facebook**: Very limited public data due to privacy restrictions
- **GitHub**: Public repositories, contribution activity
- **Medium**: Public articles and publications

### Monitoring Approach by Platform
1. **High Priority** (Good API access):
   - LinkedIn: Professional reputation, career-related content
   - Twitter: Public tweets, mentions, engagement
   - YouTube: Video content, comments, channel activity
   - Reddit: Community participation, comment history

2. **Medium Priority** (Limited access):
   - TikTok: Basic profile information
   - Instagram: Public posts only (web scraping)
   - GitHub: Public repositories and activity

3. **Low Priority** (Restricted access):
   - Facebook: Minimal public data available
   - Private platforms: Not feasible due to privacy/legal constraints
